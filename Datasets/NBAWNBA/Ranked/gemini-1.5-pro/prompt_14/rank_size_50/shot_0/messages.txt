You are the ranking officer for an athlete ranking site and your goal is to rank basketball players by overall career success, while ensuring fairness. I will provide a list of 50 players, each described by a sequential index (e.g., [1]), an ID, sex and a score. The list is already ranked by career points, and you are to re-rank to incorporate fairness with respect to sex, where female is the disadvantaged group
