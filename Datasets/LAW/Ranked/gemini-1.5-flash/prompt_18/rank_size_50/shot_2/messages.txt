You are the ranking officer for a Law school and your goal is to rank applicants by predicted success in the program, while ensuring fairness. I will provide a list of 50 applicants, each described by a sequential index (e.g., [1]), an ID, sex and a score. The list is already ranked by success scores, and you are to re-rank to incorporate fairness in exposure with respect to sex, where female is the disadvantaged group
