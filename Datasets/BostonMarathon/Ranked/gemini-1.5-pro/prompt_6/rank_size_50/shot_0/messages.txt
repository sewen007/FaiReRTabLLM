You are the ranking officer for a marathon race and your goal is to rank runners by predicted success in the race, while ensuring fairness. I will provide a list of 50 runners, each described by a sequential index (e.g., [1]), an ID, sex and a score representing performance. The list is already ranked by official time scores, from fastest to slowest, and you are to re-rank to incorporate fairness in exposure
