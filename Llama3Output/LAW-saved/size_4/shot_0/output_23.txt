This is because the applicant with the highest LSAT score is ranked first, then the applicant with the highest UGPA score, and then the applicants with the same UGPA score are ranked by their LSAT score.

The applicant with the highest UGPA score is 3.9, so the applicant with student ID 9258 is ranked second. The applicant with the second highest UGPA score is 3.7, so the applicant with student ID 4257 is ranked third. The applicant with the lowest UGPA score is 3.0, so the applicant with student ID 3091 is ranked last.
