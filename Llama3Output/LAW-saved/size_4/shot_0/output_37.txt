The ranking is based on the applicants' UGPA and LSAT scores. The higher the UGPA and LSAT scores, the higher the ranking. In this case, the top applicant is 16249 with a UGPA of 3.7 and an LSAT score of 48.0, followed by 9410 with a UGPA of 2.8 and an LSAT score of 42.0, then 8793 with a UGPA of 3.7 and an LSAT score of 34.0, and finally 6184 with a UGPA of 2.9 and an LSAT score of 39.0. The ranking is based on the total score of the applicants, which is the sum of their UGPA and LSAT scores. The ranking is then determined by sorting the applicants based on their total scores. The applicants with the highest total scores are ranked first, and so on. The ranking is then returned as a list of objects with the student ID and gender.
