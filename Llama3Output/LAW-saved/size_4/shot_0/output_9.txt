This ranking is based on a combination of the LSAT score and UGPA score. The applicants are ranked in descending order of their combined score (LSAT + UGPA). In the event of a tie, the applicant with the higher LSAT score is ranked higher. If there is still a tie, the applicant with the higher UGPA score is ranked higher. The ranking is done without considering the gender of the applicant. The result is the ranking of the applicants based on their combined score, LSAT score, and UGPA score. The ranking is as follows:
1. 16949 (female) - 42.0 + 3.4 = 45.4
2. 14676 (male) - 39.0 + 3.3 = 42.3
3. 10898 (male) - 38.0 + 3.0 = 41.0
4. 5104 (male) - 31.0 + 3.1 = 34.1

The ranked results are in the provided json format. The student ID and gender are included for each applicant. The ranking is based on the combined score (LSAT + UGPA) in descending order, with ties broken by the LSAT score and then the UGPA score. The gender is not considered in the ranking.
