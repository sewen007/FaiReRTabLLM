Here, I have ranked the applicants based on their LSAT scores. The applicant with the highest LSAT score (44.0) is ranked first, and the applicant with the lowest LSAT score (24.0) is ranked last. The UGPA scores are not considered in this ranking. The gender is also included in the output, as per the requirements.
