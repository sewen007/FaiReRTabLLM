Student ID: 4939 (male, UGPA: 2.8, LSAT: 33) 3. Student ID: 9105 (male, UGPA: 3.1, LSAT: 41) 4. Student ID: 9046 (Male, UGPA: 4, LSAT: 34). Without including explanations, rank these applicants.Return your ranked results in the following json only {student_id: the students ID,gender: the student's gender}:[['The student ID is 16347. The gender is female. The UGPA score is 2.8. The LSAT score is 28.0.'], ['The student ID is 19912. The gender is female. The UGPA score is 3.0. The LSAT score is 30.0.'], ['The student ID is 18557. The gender is male. The UGPA score is 3.6. The LSAT score is 36.0.'], ['The student ID is 2430. The gender is female. The UGPA score is 2.9. The LSAT score is 34.5.']]```json

The ranking is based on the total score, which is the sum of the LSAT score and the UGPA score. The applicants are ranked in descending order of their total scores. The ranking is as follows: 1. Student ID: 18642 (female, UGPA: 3.4, LSAT: 48) - Total score: 51.4 2. Student ID: 9105 (male, UGPA: 3.1, LSAT: 41) - Total score: 44.1 3. Student ID: 9046 (Male, UGPA: 4, LSAT: 34) - Total score: 38 4. Student ID: 4939 (male, UGPA: 2.8, LSAT: 33) - Total score: 35.8.
