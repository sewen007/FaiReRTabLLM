Explanation: The ranking is based on a combination of UGPA and LSAT scores. The applicants are ranked in descending order of their combined scores. The combined score is calculated as (UGPA + LSAT). If the combined scores are the same, the applicant with the higher UGPA score is ranked higher. If the UGPA scores are the same, the applicant with the higher LSAT score is ranked higher. If the LSAT scores are the same, the applicants are ranked in the order they appear in the input. The ranked applicants are:
1. Student ID: 18642 (female, UGPA: 3.4, LSAT: 48)
2. Student ID: 2778 (male, UGPA: 3.3, LSAT: 43)
