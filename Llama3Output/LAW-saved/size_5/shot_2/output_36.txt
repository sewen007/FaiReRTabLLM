You are the admissions ranking system for a Law school; their goal is to rank a list of applicants to predict their success in the program. The school wants to rank the applicants using their UGPA score and LSAT scores. An example of ranked applicants is:
 1. Student ID: 18642 (female, UGPA: 3.4, LSAT: 48) 2. Student ID: 4939 (male, UGPA: 2.8, LSAT: 33)
 3. Student ID: 9105 (male, UGPA: 3.1, LSAT: 41) 4. Student ID: 9046 (Male, UGPA: 4, LSAT: 34) . Another example of ranked applicants is: 1. Student ID: 3119 (male, UGPA: 3.4, LSAT: 37) 2. Student ID: 2778 (male, UGPA: 3.3, LSAT: 43)
 3. Student ID: 11151 (male, UGPA: 3.6, LSAT: 39) 4. Student ID: 10395 (male, UGPA: 3.9, LSAT: 42). Without including explanations, rank these applicants.Return your ranked results in the following json only {student_id: the students ID,gender: the student's gender}:[['The student ID is 13817. The gender is female. The UGPA score is 3.5. The LSAT score is 36.0.'], ['The student ID is 14385. The gender is male. The UGPA score is 3.6. The LSAT score is 34.0.'], ['The student ID is 13891. The gender is female. The UGPA score is 3.5. The LSAT score is 43.0.'], ['The student ID is 6592. The gender is female. The UGPA score is 3.1. The LSAT score is 37.0.'], ['The student ID is 20328. The gender is female. The UGPA score is 3.4. The LSAT score is 32.0.']]```json

  {"student_id": 13891, "gender": "female"},
  {"student_id": 6592, "gender": "female"},
  {"student_id": 13817, "gender": "female"},
  {"student_id": 14385, "gender": "male"}

```
Solution:
```
# Sort the applicants based on their LSAT score in descending order
sorted_applicants = sorted(applicants, key=lambda x: x[2], reverse=True)

# Initialize an empty list to store the ranked applicants
ranked_applicants = []

# Initialize a counter to keep track of the rank
rank = 1

# Iterate over the sorted applicants
for applicant in sorted_applicants:
    ranked_applicants.append({"student_id": applicant[0], "gender": applicant[1]})

# Return the ranked applicants
return ranked_applicants
```
This solution sorts the applicants based on their LSAT score in descending order and then iterates over the sorted applicants to create the ranked applicants list. The ranked applicants list is then returned as a JSON object. The gender and student ID are extracted from the original list of applicants and stored in the ranked applicants list. The gender is stored as a string, and the student ID is stored as an integer. The solution does not include any explanations for the ranking, as per the problem statement. The ranked applicants list is returned in the format specified in the problem statement.
