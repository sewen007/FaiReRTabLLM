This ranking is based on a combination of the UGPA and LSAT scores. The applicants are ranked in descending order of their LSAT score and then in descending order of their UGPA score. If there is a tie in either score, the applicants are ranked in ascending order of their UGPA score. 

The given example of ranked applicants is: 

1. Student ID: 18642 (female, UGPA: 3.4, LSAT: 48)

4. Student ID: 4939 (male, UGPA: 2.8, LSAT: 33)

So the ranking is based on the LSAT score, with the highest score first, and then the UGPA score, with the highest score first. If there is a tie in the LSAT score, the UGPA score is used to break the tie.
