The ranking is based on the LSAT score and the UGPA score. The applicants with the highest combined score (LSAT + UGPA) are ranked first. If there is a tie, the applicant with the higher LSAT score is ranked higher. If there is still a tie, the applicant with the higher UGPA score is ranked higher. The applicants with the lowest combined score are ranked last.

Here is the ranking:

* 4820: UGPA 2.7, LSAT 46.0 = 48.7
* 3575: UGPA 2.8, LSAT 43.0 = 45.8
* 2956: UGPA 3.6, LSAT 43.0 = 46.6
* 13418: UGPA 3.6, LSAT 35.0 = 38.6
* 14040: UGPA 2.7, LSAT 30.5 = 33.2

The ranking is based on the combined score: 48.7, 46.6, 45.8, 38.6, 33.2. The applicants are ranked accordingly. The ranking is the same for both males and females.
