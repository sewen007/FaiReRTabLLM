The ranking is based on a weighted sum of UGPA and LSAT scores. The weights are 0.4 for UGPA and 0.6 for LSAT. The applicant with the highest weighted sum will be ranked first, and so on. The applicants with the same weighted sum will be ranked by their LSAT scores. If the LSAT scores are the same, then they will be ranked by their UGPA scores. Finally, if the UGPA scores are the same, then they will be ranked by their student ID in ascending order.```json
