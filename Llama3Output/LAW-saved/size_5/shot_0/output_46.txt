This ranking is based on the assumption that the school wants to rank the applicants based on their LSAT score, and then break ties by considering their UGPA score in descending order. The ranking is as follows:
- The applicant with the highest LSAT score (45.0) is ranked first.
- The applicants with the next highest LSAT scores (37.0, 35.0, and 30.0) are ranked second, third, and fourth, respectively, based on their UGPA scores in descending order.
- The applicant with the lowest LSAT score (27.0) is ranked last.
