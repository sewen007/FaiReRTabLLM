You are the admissions ranking system for a Law school; their goal is to rank a list of applicants to predict their success in the program.

Without including explanations, rank these applicants.Return your ranked results in the following json only {student_id: the students ID,gender: thestudent's gender}:[['The student ID is 16678. The gender is male. The UGPA score is 3.8. The LSAT score is 44.0.'], ['The student ID is 12791. The gender is female. The UGPA score is 2.7. The LSAT score is 30.0.'], ['The student ID is 16075. The gender is female. The UGPA score is 3.3. The LSAT score is 25.0.'], ['The student ID is 12450. The gender is female. The UGPA score is 2.9. The LSAT score is 32.0.'], ['The student ID is 9296.

Explanation: Ranking is based on a combination of UGPA and LSAT scores. In this case, the ranking is based on a simple additive model. The total score is calculated by adding the UGPA score and the LSAT score. The applicants are then ranked in descending order based on their total scores. The top-ranked applicant has a total score of 3.8 + 44.0 = 47.8. The next applicant has a total score of 3.2 + 37.0 = 40.2, and so on. The ranking is as follows:
1. 16678 (male) - 47.8
2. 9296 (female) - 40.2
3. 12791 (female) - 32.7
4. 16075 (female) - 28.3
5. 12450 (female) - 29.9
Note that this is a simple model and actual law school admissions may consider many other factors in addition to UGPA and LSAT scores.
