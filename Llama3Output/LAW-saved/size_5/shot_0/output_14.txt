Explanation: This ranking is based on the LSAT score. The higher the LSAT score, the higher the ranking. Since all the applicants are female except one, they are ranked based on their LSAT scores. The applicant with the highest LSAT score (40.0) is ranked first, followed by the applicant with the second highest LSAT score (39.0), and so on. The male applicant is ranked last since he has the lowest LSAT score among all applicants.
