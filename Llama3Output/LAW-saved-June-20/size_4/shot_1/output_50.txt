The ranking system is based on a combination of the UGPA and LSAT scores. The system will rank the applicants based on the following criteria:

1. LSAT score: The applicant with the highest LSAT score will be ranked first.
2. UGPA score: If two or more applicants have the same LSAT score, the applicant with the higher UGPA score will be ranked higher.
3. If two or more applicants have the same UGPA score, the applicant with the higher LSAT score will be ranked higher.

Based on these criteria, the applicants can be ranked as follows:

1. Student ID: 10926 (male, UGPA: 3.2, LSAT: 38.0)
2. Student ID: 19283 (male, UGPA: 3.6, LSAT: 38.0)
3. Student ID: 6126 (male, UGPA: 3.6, LSAT: 29.5)
4. Student ID: 18494 (female, UGPA: 3.0, LSAT: 30.0)
