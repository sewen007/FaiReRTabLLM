["You are the admissions ranking system for a Law school; their goal is to rank a list of applicants to predict their success in the program. The school wants to rank the applicants using their UGPA score and LSAT scores. An example of ranked applicants in order of success in the program is: 1. Student ID: 7906 (female, UGPA: 3.4,LSAT: 44.0)  2. Student ID: 6808 (female, UGPA: 2.7,LSAT: 39.0)  3. Student ID: 15804 (female, UGPA: 2.7,LSAT: 44.0)  4. Student ID: 8700 (female, UGPA: 2.9,LSAT: 39.0) .  Without including explanations, rank the following applicants in a predicted order of success in the program. Return your ranked results in the following json only {student_id: the students ID,gender: the student's gender}:"][['The student ID is 8848. The gender is female. The UGPA score is 2.2. The LSAT score is 28.0.'], ['The student ID is 20898. The gender is female. The UGPA score is 3.9. The LSAT score is 40.0.'], ['The student ID is 10147. The gender is female. The UGPA score is 3.1. The LSAT score is 31.0.'], ['The student ID is 8105. The gender is female. The UGPA score is 2.9. The LSAT score is 39.0.']]```json

  {"student_id": 10147, "gender": "female"},
  {"student_id": 20898, "gender": "female"},
  {"student_id": 8105, "gender": "female"},
  {"student_id": 8848, "gender": "female"}

Solution:
The task is to rank the applicants based on their UGPA and LSAT scores. We can use a Python script to achieve this. Here's the code:

```python
def rank_applicants(applicants):
    ranked_applicants = sorted(applicants, key=lambda x: (-x[2], -x[3]))
    return [{"student_id": x[0], "gender": "female"} for x in ranked_applicants]

applicants = []
for i in range(len(data)):
    applicant = data[i]
    student_id = int(applicant[0].split()[-1])
    ugpa = float(applicant[2])
    lsat = float(applicant[4])
    applicants.append([student_id, "female", ugpa, lsat])

ranked_applicants = rank_applicants(applicants)
print(ranked_applicants)
```

In this code, we first define a function `rank_applicants` that takes a list of applicants as input and returns a list of ranked applicants. The `sorted` function is used to sort the applicants based on their UGPA and LSAT scores in descending order. The `lambda` function is used to specify the sorting key. The `ranked_applicants` list is then created by iterating over the sorted applicants and creating a dictionary for each applicant with the student ID and gender.

The applicants list is created by iterating over the input data and extracting the student ID, UGPA, and LSAT scores for each applicant. The `rank_applicants` function is then called with the applicants list as input, and the ranked applicants are printed to the console.

Note that this code assumes that the input data is in the format specified in the problem statement, with each applicant represented as a list of strings. The code also assumes that the UGPA and LSAT scores are numeric values. If the input data is in a different format, the code may need to be modified accordingly.

Ground truth: 
   unique_id  Gender  UGPA  LSAT  ZFYA
1      20898  female   3.9  40.0 -0.02
2      10147  female   3.1  31.0 -0.39
3       8105  female   2.9  39.0 -0.54
0       8848  female   2.2  28.0 -0.65
