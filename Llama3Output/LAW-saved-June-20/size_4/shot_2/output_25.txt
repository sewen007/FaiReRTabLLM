Student ID: 3432 (female, UGPA: 3.3,LSAT: 37.0) . Another example of ranked applicants in order of success in the program is: 1. Student ID: 13094 (female, UGPA: 3.5,LSAT: 42.0)  2. Student ID: 19422 (male, UGPA: 3.6,LSAT: 37.0)  3. Student ID: 2994 (female, UGPA: 3.8,LSAT: 44.0)  4. Student ID: 12957 (male, UGPA: 3.2,LSAT: 35.0) .  Without including explanations, rank the following applicants in a predicted order of success in the program. Return your ranked results in the following json only {student_id: the students ID,gender: the student's gender}:"][['The student ID is 3096. The gender is female. The UGPA score is 3.4. The LSAT score is 29.0.'], ['The student ID is 19017. The gender is male. The UGPA score is 3.7. The LSAT score is 48.0.'], ['The student ID is 5031. The gender is male. The UGPA score is 3.8.

This code creates a function that takes in a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents an applicant. The function then calculates a ranking score for each applicant by multiplying their UGPA score by their LSAT score. The applicants are then sorted in descending order based on their ranking score. The function returns a list of dictionaries where each dictionary contains the student ID and gender of the applicant. The list is sorted in the predicted order of success in the program. The ranking score is used to determine the order of the applicants. The UGPA score and LSAT score are used to calculate the ranking score. The applicants with the highest ranking scores are ranked first. The applicants with the lowest ranking scores are ranked last. The function is then called with the provided list of applicants and the results are returned as a JSON string.
