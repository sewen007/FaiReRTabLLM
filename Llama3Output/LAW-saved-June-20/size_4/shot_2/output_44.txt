The UGPA score is the grade point average of the student in their undergraduate studies. The LSAT score is the Law School Admission Test score. The ranking is determined by the combination of these two scores. The applicants with higher UGPA and LSAT scores are ranked higher in the list. If the UGPA scores are the same, the applicants are ranked based on their LSAT scores. If the LSAT scores are the same, the applicants are ranked based on their UGPA scores. The ranking is based on the predicted order of success in the program, which means that the applicants with higher UGPA and LSAT scores are more likely to succeed in the program.
