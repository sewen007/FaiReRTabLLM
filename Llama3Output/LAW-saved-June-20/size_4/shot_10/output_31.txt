This ranking is based on the assumption that the admissions ranking system uses a combination of the UGPA and LSAT scores to predict the success of the applicants in the program. The ranking is based on the following criteria:

1. LSAT score: The LSAT score is the primary factor in the ranking. The applicants with the higher LSAT scores are ranked higher.
2. UGPA score: The UGPA score is the secondary factor in the ranking. The applicants with the higher UGPA scores are ranked higher.
3. Tiebreaker: In case of a tie, the applicant with the higher LSAT score is ranked higher.

The ranked results are returned in the format of a JSON array, where each object represents an applicant and contains the student ID and gender. The applicants are ranked in the order of their predicted success in the program.
