**Note:** This is a simple ranking system and does not take into account other factors that may affect a student's success in the program. The ranking is based solely on the provided UGPA and LSAT scores. The ranking system used is a simple weighted average of the UGPA and LSAT scores. The weights used are 0.6 for UGPA and 0.4 for LSAT. The ranking is done by sorting the applicants based on their weighted average scores in descending order. If two or more applicants have the same weighted average score, they are ranked based on their LSAT score in descending order. If two or more applicants have the same LSAT score, they are ranked based on their UGPA score in descending order. If two or more applicants have the same UGPA score, they are ranked based on their student ID in ascending order.
