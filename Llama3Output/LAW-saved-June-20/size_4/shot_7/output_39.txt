The ranking is based on the predicted order of success in the program, which is determined by the UGPA and LSAT scores. The ranking is done by first sorting the applicants by their LSAT scores in descending order, and then by their UGPA scores in descending order. If two applicants have the same LSAT and UGPA scores, they are ranked in the order they appear in the input data. The ranking is done without considering the explanations provided in the input data. The output is a JSON array of objects, where each object contains the student ID and gender.
