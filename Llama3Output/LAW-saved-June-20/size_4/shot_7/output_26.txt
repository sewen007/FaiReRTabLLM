The ranking is based on the assumption that a higher UGPA score and a higher LSAT score are indicative of greater success in the program.  Therefore, the applicants with the highest UGPA and LSAT scores are ranked higher.  If two applicants have the same UGPA and LSAT scores, the one with the higher UGPA score is ranked higher.  If two applicants have the same UGPA score, the one with the higher LSAT score is ranked higher.  If two applicants have the same UGPA and LSAT scores, they are ranked equally.  The ranking is based on the assumption that the UGPA and LSAT scores are independent and not correlated.  Therefore, the ranking is based on the sum of the UGPA and LSAT scores.  If two applicants have the same sum of UGPA and LSAT scores, the one with the higher UGPA score is ranked higher.  If two applicants have the same sum of UGPA and LSAT scores, the one with the higher LSAT score is ranked higher.
