I will be happy to provide the explanation if needed.

Please note that the ranking system used here is a simple one and does not reflect the actual ranking system used by law schools. The actual ranking system is more complex and takes into account many factors, including the student's undergraduate major, work experience, and personal statement, in addition to their UGPA and LSAT scores.
