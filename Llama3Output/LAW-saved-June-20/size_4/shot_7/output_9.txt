This code will rank the applicants in a predicted order of success in the program based on their UGPA score and LSAT score. The ranking is based on the examples provided in the problem statement, which show that the applicants with higher UGPA and LSAT scores are more likely to be successful in the program. The ranking is done by comparing the UGPA and LSAT scores of each applicant with those of the other applicants. The applicant with the highest UGPA and LSAT scores is ranked first, and so on. If two or more applicants have the same UGPA and LSAT scores, they are ranked based on their gender, with female applicants ranked higher than male applicants. If two or more applicants have the same UGPA and LSAT scores and are the same gender, they are ranked randomly. The ranked results are returned in a JSON object with the student ID and gender of each applicant.
