The ranking system is based on the UGPA score and LSAT score. The UGPA score is the grade point average of the applicant's undergraduate studies. The LSAT score is the score of the applicant's Law School Admission Test. The ranking is based on the combination of these two scores. The applicants with the highest UGPA and LSAT scores are ranked highest. If two applicants have the same UGPA score, the one with the higher LSAT score is ranked higher. If two applicants have the same LSAT score, the one with the higher UGPA score is ranked higher. The applicants with the lowest UGPA and LSAT scores are ranked lowest. If two applicants have the same UGPA and LSAT scores, they are ranked equally. The ranking is done based on the data provided, without considering any other factors. The ranking is based on the assumption that a higher UGPA score and LSAT score indicate a higher potential for success in the program. The ranking is also based on the assumption that the UGPA score and LSAT score are independent and not correlated. The ranking is based on the data provided, without considering any other factors.
