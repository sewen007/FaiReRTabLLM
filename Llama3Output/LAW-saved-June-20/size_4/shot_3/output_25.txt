The ranking is based on the UGPA and LSAT scores. The UGPA score is ranked from highest to lowest. The LSAT score is ranked from highest to lowest. In the event of a tie, the applicant with the higher UGPA score is ranked higher. If there is still a tie, the applicant with the higher LSAT score is ranked higher. If there is still a tie, the applicants are ranked in the order they were received. The ranked applicants are then returned in the format specified. Note that the ranking is based on the assumption that the applicants are ranked in the order they were received. If the applicants were ranked randomly, the ranking would be different.
