The ranking system is based on the applicants' UGPA and LSAT scores. In this case, the system ranks the applicants in descending order of their UGPA score and then in descending order of their LSAT score. The system also considers the gender of the applicants, but in this case, it does not affect the ranking. The ranked results are returned in the specified JSON format.
