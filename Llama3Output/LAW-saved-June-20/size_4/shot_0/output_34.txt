This code will rank the applicants based on their UGPA and LSAT scores. The ranking is based on the assumption that a higher UGPA and LSAT score will predict a higher level of success in the program. The applicants are ranked in descending order of their combined score, with the highest combined score ranking first. If two applicants have the same combined score, they are ranked based on their UGPA score, with the higher UGPA score ranking first. If two applicants have the same UGPA score, they are ranked based on their LSAT score, with the higher LSAT score ranking first. The gender of the applicants is not used in the ranking. The ranking is then returned in the specified JSON format.
