This Python code creates a DataFrame from the given data, sorts it by UGPA and then by LSAT, and then converts it to a list of dictionaries. The result is the ranked list of applicants. Note that the sorting is done in ascending order for UGPA and descending order for LSAT, which means that the applicants with higher UGPA scores and higher LSAT scores will be ranked higher.
