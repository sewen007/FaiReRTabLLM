The ranking is based on the assumption that the school is looking for a combination of strong academic performance (UGPA) and strong LSAT scores. The applicants with higher UGPA scores and higher LSAT scores are ranked higher. If there is a tie in UGPA scores, the applicant with the higher LSAT score is ranked higher. If there is a tie in both UGPA and LSAT scores, the applicant with the higher UGPA score is ranked higher. If there is still a tie, the applicants are ranked in the order they were received.
