Explanation:
The ranking is based on the combination of UGPA score and LSAT score. The applicant with the highest total score (UGPA + LSAT) is ranked first. If the total scores are equal, the applicant with the higher LSAT score is ranked higher. If both scores are equal, the applicant with the higher UGPA score is ranked higher. The applicants are ranked in the order of 10428, 15089, 11203, and 12467.
