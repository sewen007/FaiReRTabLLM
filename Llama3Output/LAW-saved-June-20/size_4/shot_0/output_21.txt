The ranking is based on the predicted order of success in the program, which is determined by the combination of the UGPA score and the LSAT score. The applicants are ranked in descending order of their LSAT scores and then in descending order of their UGPA scores. If two applicants have the same LSAT score, they are ranked in descending order of their UGPA scores. If two applicants have the same UGPA score, they are ranked in descending order of their LSAT scores.

In this case, the ranking is:

1. 19687 (male) - 41.0 LSAT, 2.8 UGPA
2. 14137 (female) - 32.0 LSAT, 2.5 UGPA
3. 6356 (male) - 28.0 LSAT, 3.3 UGPA
4. 21625 (female) - 23.0 LSAT, 3.1 UGPA

This ranking is reflected in the output JSON.
