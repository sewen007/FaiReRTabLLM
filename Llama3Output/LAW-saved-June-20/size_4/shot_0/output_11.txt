The ranking is based on the predicted order of success in the program. The applicants are ranked based on their UGPA and LSAT scores. The ranking is done in the following order:
1. LSAT score
2. UGPA score

The highest LSAT score and highest UGPA score correspond to the highest predicted order of success in the program. The ranking is done in descending order for LSAT score and in ascending order for UGPA score. This means that the applicant with the highest LSAT score and highest UGPA score is ranked first, and the applicant with the lowest LSAT score and lowest UGPA score is ranked last.
