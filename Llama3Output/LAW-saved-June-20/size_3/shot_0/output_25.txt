The ranking system is based on the LSAT score, with higher scores indicating greater predicted success in the program.  The UGPA score is also important, but the system places more emphasis on the LSAT score.  Therefore, the applicants with the highest LSAT scores are ranked first, and then the applicants with the highest UGPA scores are ranked.  In this case, the applicants are ranked as follows: 19017, 5031, and 3096.
