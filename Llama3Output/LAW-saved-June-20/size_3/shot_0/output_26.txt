Solution:
The ranking system uses a combination of UGPA score and LSAT score to predict the success of the applicants in the program. The ranking is based on the following criteria:

1. LSAT score: The applicant with the highest LSAT score is ranked first.
2. UGPA score: If two or more applicants have the same LSAT score, the applicant with the higher UGPA score is ranked higher.
3. Gender: If two or more applicants have the same LSAT and UGPA scores, the applicant with the same gender as the previous ranked applicant is ranked next.

Based on the given information, the ranking is as follows:

1. The applicant with the highest LSAT score is 18836 with a score of 39.0. Since there are no other applicants with the same LSAT score, he is ranked first.
2. The applicant with the next highest LSAT score is 21700 with a score of 37.0. Since there are no other applicants with the same LSAT score, he is ranked second.
3. The applicant with the lowest LSAT score is 15983 with a score of 22.0. Since there are no other applicants with the same LSAT score, she is ranked third.

The final ranking is:
```json
[
  {"student_id": 18836, "gender": "male"},
  {"student_id": 21700, "gender": "male"},
  {"student_id": 15983, "gender": "female"}
]
```json
```
Note: The ranking is based on the given information and may not reflect the actual ranking that would be used in a real-world scenario. The ranking system may also take into account other factors such as work experience, extracurricular activities, and personal statements.
