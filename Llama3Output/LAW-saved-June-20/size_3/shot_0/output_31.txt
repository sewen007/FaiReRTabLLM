Explanation: The applicants are ranked based on their LSAT scores and UGPA scores. The LSAT score is given more weightage as it is a more accurate predictor of success in law school. The applicants are ranked in descending order of their LSAT scores, and then in descending order of their UGPA scores. In case of a tie, the applicant with the higher UGPA score is ranked higher. Therefore, the ranked order is 1909, 16862, and 9697.
