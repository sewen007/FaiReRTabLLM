The ranking system uses a combination of UGPA and LSAT scores. In this case, it seems that the ranking system prioritizes LSAT scores over UGPA scores. Therefore, the applicants are ranked based on their LSAT scores. The applicant with the highest LSAT score is ranked first, the applicant with the second highest LSAT score is ranked second, and so on.

Here is the ranking:

1. Student ID: 14891 (male, UGPA: 3.1, LSAT: 36.5)
2. Student ID: 2311 (male, UGPA: 3.1, LSAT: 34.0)
3. Student ID: 16765 (female, UGPA: 2.4, LSAT: 35.0)

The ranked results are returned in the specified JSON format.
