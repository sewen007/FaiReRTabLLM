The ranking system is based on a combination of the UGPA and LSAT scores. The ranking is based on the following criteria:

1. Higher LSAT score
2. Higher UGPA score

If two applicants have the same LSAT score, the one with the higher UGPA score is ranked higher. If two applicants have the same UGPA score, the one with the higher LSAT score is ranked higher.

Using this criteria, the applicants are ranked as follows:

1. 14589 (female, 3.3, 36.0) - higher UGPA and same LSAT score as 10197, so ranked higher
2. 10197 (female, 2.5, 36.0) - same UGPA and LSAT score as 4938, so ranked lower
3. 4938 (male, 2.8, 39.0) - higher LSAT score than 10197, so ranked higher

The ranked results are returned in the specified JSON format.
