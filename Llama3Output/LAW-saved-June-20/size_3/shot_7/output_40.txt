Solution:
The ranking system is based on a combination of the UGPA score and the LSAT score. The applicants are ranked in order of their success in the program. The ranking is based on the following criteria:
1. The applicant with the highest LSAT score is ranked first.
2. If two or more applicants have the same LSAT score, the applicant with the higher UGPA score is ranked higher.
3. If two or more applicants have the same UGPA score and LSAT score, they are ranked in the order they appear in the list.

Based on these criteria, the ranked applicants are:
1. Student ID: 2525 (female, UGPA: 2.4,LSAT: 40.0)
2. Student ID: 15459 (male, UGPA: 3.0,LSAT: 34.0)
3. Student ID: 18381 (female, UGPA: 1.9,LSAT: 35.0)

The ranked results in the desired json format are:
```
[
  {"student_id":2525,"gender":"female"},
  {"student_id":15459,"gender":"male"},
  {"student_id":18381,"gender":"female"}
]
```json
```
Explanation:
The ranking is based on the combination of the UGPA score and the LSAT score. The applicant with the highest LSAT score (40.0) is ranked first. The applicant with the next highest LSAT score (35.0) is ranked second, and the applicant with the lowest LSAT score (34.0) is ranked third. Since the UGPA scores are not the same, the ranking is based solely on the LSAT scores. If the UGPA scores were the same, the ranking would be based on the UGPA scores. If both the UGPA and LSAT scores were the same, the ranking would be based on the order of appearance in the list.
