The ranking is based on the applicants' UGPA and LSAT scores. The applicants are ranked in order of their predicted success in the program. The ranking is based on the following criteria: 

1. LSAT score: The applicants with the higher LSAT scores are ranked higher. 
2. UGPA score: The applicants with the higher UGPA scores are ranked higher.

In the case of a tie in LSAT score, the applicant with the higher UGPA score is ranked higher. If there is still a tie, the applicants are ranked in the order they are received.

Note that the actual ranking may vary based on the specific ranking criteria used by the law school. This solution is based on the provided examples and may not reflect the actual ranking criteria used by the law school.
