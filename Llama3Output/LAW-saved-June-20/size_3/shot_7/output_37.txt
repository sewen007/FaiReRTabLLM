This ranking system uses a combination of the student's undergraduate GPA (UGPA) and Law School Admission Test (LSAT) scores to predict their success in the program. The ranking is based on the following criteria:

1. LSAT score: Higher scores indicate greater success in the program.
2. UGPA score: Higher scores indicate greater success in the program.
3. Combination of LSAT and UGPA scores: Students with higher LSAT scores and higher UGPA scores are more likely to be successful in the program.

Based on the provided examples, the ranking system appears to prioritize LSAT scores over UGPA scores. For example, in the first example, Student ID 101 has a higher LSAT score (42.0) than Student ID 17771 (33.0), despite having a lower UGPA score (2.5 vs 3.4). Similarly, in the second example, Student ID 13282 has a higher LSAT score (48.0) than Student ID 5379 (38.0), despite having a higher UGPA score (3.8 vs 3.7).

Using this ranking system, the provided applicants can be ranked as follows:

1. Student ID 16249 (male, UGPA: 3.7, LSAT: 48.0) - highest LSAT score and high UGPA score
2. Student ID 9410 (male, UGPA: 2.8, LSAT: 42.0) - high LSAT score and relatively low UGPA score
3. Student ID 6184 (female, UGPA: 2.9, LSAT: 39.0) - relatively low LSAT score and moderate UGPA score
