The school wants to rank the applicants using their UGPA score and LSAT scores. An example of ranked applicants in order of success in the program is: 1. Student ID: 5587 (female, UGPA: 3.2,LSAT: 32.5)  2. Student ID: 17433 (female, UGPA: 3.4,LSAT: 35.0)  3. Student ID: 19239 (male, UGPA: 3.6,LSAT: 34.0) . Another example of ranked applicants in order of success in the program is: 1. Student ID: 5656 (male, UGPA: 3.7,LSAT: 37.0)  2. Student ID: 4375 (male, UGPA: 3.7,LSAT: 38.0)  3. Student ID: 2891 (female, UGPA: 3.5,LSAT: 41.0) . Yet another example of ranked applicants in order of success in the program is: 1. Student ID: 1235 (female, UGPA: 2.9,LSAT: 26.5)  2.

Without including explanations, rank the following applicants in a predicted order of success in the program. Return your ranked results in the following json only {student_id: the students ID,gender: the student's gender}:"][['The student ID is 9261. The gender is female. The UGPA score is 3.1. The LSAT score is 41.0.'], ['The student ID is 11190. The gender is female. The UGPA score is 2.4. The LSAT score is 39.0.'], ['The student ID is 1443. The gender is female. The UGPA score is 3.2.
