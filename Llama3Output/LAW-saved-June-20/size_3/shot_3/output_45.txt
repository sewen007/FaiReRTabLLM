The ranking is based on the UGPA score and the LSAT score. The applicants are ranked in order of their predicted success in the program. The ranking is based on the following rules:

1. The UGPA score is used as the primary ranking factor. The applicants are ranked in order of their UGPA score, with the highest UGPA score ranked first.
2. In the event of a tie in the UGPA score, the LSAT score is used as the secondary ranking factor. The applicants are ranked in order of their LSAT score, with the highest LSAT score ranked first.
3. If there is still a tie after considering both the UGPA and LSAT scores, the applicants are ranked in alphabetical order by student ID.

The ranking is based on the assumption that applicants with higher UGPA scores and LSAT scores are more likely to be successful in the program. The ranking is intended to predict the success of the applicants in the program.
