The ranking is based on the predicted order of success in the program, which is determined by the combination of the UGPA score and the LSAT score. The higher the UGPA score and the higher the LSAT score, the higher the predicted order of success in the program. The ranking is based on the weighted average of the UGPA score and the LSAT score, where the UGPA score is weighted at 0.4 and the LSAT score is weighted at 0.6. The ranking is then based on the weighted average of the UGPA score and the LSAT score, with the highest weighted average indicating the highest predicted order of success in the program.
