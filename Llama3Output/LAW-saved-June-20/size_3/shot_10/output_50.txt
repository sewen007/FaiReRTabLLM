The ranking system is based on the applicant's UGPA score and LSAT score. The higher the UGPA score and the higher the LSAT score, the higher the predicted success in the program. The ranking system is based on the following criteria: 

1. The UGPA score is a strong indicator of success in the program. A higher UGPA score indicates a higher predicted success in the program.
2. The LSAT score is also a strong indicator of success in the program. A higher LSAT score indicates a higher predicted success in the program.
3. In the event of a tie in UGPA score, the LSAT score is used to break the tie. A higher LSAT score indicates a higher predicted success in the program.
4. In the event of a tie in both UGPA and LSAT scores, the applicant with the higher UGPA score is ranked higher.

Here are the ranked results in the json format:
