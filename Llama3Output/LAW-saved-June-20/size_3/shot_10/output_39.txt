Solution:

To rank the applicants in a predicted order of success in the program, we need to analyze the given examples of ranked applicants and identify the pattern. From the examples, we can see that the applicants are ranked based on a combination of their UGPA and LSAT scores. 

A possible ranking system could be to first rank the applicants based on their LSAT scores in descending order (highest to lowest), and then rank them based on their UGPA scores in descending order (highest to lowest) if their LSAT scores are the same.

Using this ranking system, we can rank the given applicants as follows:

1. Student ID: 13329 (male, UGPA: 3.7, LSAT: 46.0)
2. Student ID: 14941 (male, UGPA: 3.3, LSAT: 40.0)
3. Student ID: 15242 (male, UGPA: 3.1, LSAT: 27.5)

Here is the ranked result in the required JSON format:
```json
[
    {"student_id": 13329, "gender": "male"},
    {"student_id": 14941, "gender": "male"},
    {"student_id": 15242, "gender": "male"}
]
```
Note that this is just one possible ranking system, and there may be other ways to rank the applicants based on their UGPA and LSAT scores. The actual ranking system used by the law school may be different.
