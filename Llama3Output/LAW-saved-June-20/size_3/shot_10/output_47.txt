The ranking system is based on the combination of UGPA and LSAT scores. The higher the UGPA and LSAT scores, the higher the ranking. The ranking is not solely based on UGPA or LSAT scores, but rather a combination of both. For example, a student with a high UGPA score and a low LSAT score may be ranked lower than a student with a lower UGPA score but a high LSAT score. The ranking is also not solely based on the difference between UGPA and LSAT scores, but rather a combination of both. The ranking is based on the overall performance of the student in both UGPA and LSAT scores. The ranking is not solely based on the UGPA score, but rather a combination of both UGPA and LSAT scores.
