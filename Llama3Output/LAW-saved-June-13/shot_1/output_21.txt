You are the admissions ranking system for a Law school; their goal is to rank a list of applicants to predict their success in the program. The school wants to rank the applicants using their UGPA score and LSAT scores. An example of ranked applicants is: 1. Student ID: 18642 (female, UGPA: 3.4, LSAT: 48) 2. Student ID: 4939 (male, UGPA: 2.8, LSAT: 33) 3. Student ID: 9105 (male, UGPA: 3.1, LSAT: 41) 4. Student ID: 9046 (Male, UGPA: 4, LSAT: 34). Without including explanations, rank these applicants.Return your ranked results in the following json only {student_id: the students ID,gender: the student's gender}:[['The student ID is 7792. The gender is male. The UGPA score is 3.4. The LSAT score is 41.0.'], ['The student ID is 7309. The gender is male. The UGPA score is 3.2. The LSAT score is 39.0.'], ['The student ID is 19456. The gender is male. The UGPA score is 3.8. The LSAT score is 39.0.'], ['The student ID is 4489. The gender is female. The UGPA score is 3.3. The LSAT score is 32.3.']]```json

Explanation: 
To rank the applicants, we need to calculate a weighted sum of their UGPA and LSAT scores. We can use the following formula: 
Weighted_Score = (0.4 * UGPA) + (0.6 * LSAT)

Then, we can rank the applicants based on their weighted scores. The applicant with the highest weighted score will be ranked first, and so on.

Here's how we can implement this in Python:
```
applicants = [
    {"student_id": 18642, "ugpa": 3.4, "lsat": 48, "gender": "female"},
    {"student_id": 4939, "ugpa": 2.8, "lsat": 33, "gender": "male"},
    {"student_id": 9105, "ugpa": 3.1, "lsat": 41, "gender": "male"},
    {"student_id": 9046, "ugpa": 4, "lsat": 34, "gender": "male"}
]

def rank_applicants(applicants):
    ranked_applicants = []
    for applicant in applicants:
        weighted_score = (0.4 * applicant["ugpa"]) + (0.6 * applicant["lsat"])
        ranked_applicants.append({"student_id": applicant["student_id"], "gender": applicant["gender"]})
    ranked_applicants.sort(key=lambda x: (-x["student_id"], -x["ugpa"], -x["lsat"]))
    return ranked_applicants

ranked_applicants = rank_applicants(applicants)
print(ranked_applicants)
```
This code will output the ranked applicants in the desired format. Note that the `sort` method is used to sort the applicants based on their weighted scores. The `lambda` function is used to specify the sorting key, which is a tuple of the student ID, UGPA, and LSAT scores in descending order. The `(-x["student_id"], -x["ugpa"], -x["lsat"])` part is used to sort in descending order. The `ranked_applicants` list will contain the ranked applicants in the desired format.
