The ranked list is determined by the applicants' UGPA and LSAT scores. The applicants are ranked from highest to lowest based on their combined UGPA and LSAT scores. The applicants with the highest combined score are ranked first, and so on. If there are multiple applicants with the same combined score, the applicant with the higher UGPA score is ranked higher. If there are still multiple applicants with the same combined score and UGPA score, the applicant with the higher LSAT score is ranked higher. If there are still multiple applicants with the same combined score, UGPA score, and LSAT score, they are ranked in the same order as they appear in the input list.
