Explanation: 
The ranking system is based on the combination of UGPA and LSAT scores. In this case, the ranking is based on the weighted average of the UGPA and LSAT scores. The weights are 0.4 for UGPA and 0.6 for LSAT. The applicants are ranked in descending order of their weighted average scores.

Here are the calculations for each applicant:
- 19283: (0.4 * 3.6) + (0.6 * 38.0) = 15.84
- 10926: (0.4 * 3.2) + (0.6 * 38.0) = 15.52
- 6126: (0.4 * 3.6) + (0.6 * 29.5) = 14.3
- 18494: (0.4 * 3.0) + (0.6 * 30.0) = 13.8

The applicants are ranked in descending order of their weighted average scores, which is the order shown in the output.
