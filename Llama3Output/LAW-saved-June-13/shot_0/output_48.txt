The ranking is based on a combination of the UGPA and LSAT scores. The UGPA score is weighted at 40% and the LSAT score is weighted at 60%. The scores are then combined to create a total score. The applicants are ranked based on their total score. Here is the ranking:

1. 10770 (female) - 2.9 UGPA, 41.0 LSAT, total score = 0.9*2.9 + 0.6*41.0 = 29.54
2. 4617 (male) - 3.3 UGPA, 33.0 LSAT, total score = 0.9*3.3 + 0.6*33.0 = 26.53
3. 19774 (male) - 3.6 UGPA, 30.0 LSAT, total score = 0.9*3.6 + 0.6*30.0 = 25.8
4. 10632 (female) - 2.6 UGPA, 27.0 LSAT, total score = 0.9*2.6 + 0.6*27.0 = 21.06

The ranking is based on the total score. The highest total score corresponds to the lowest rank. Therefore, the ranking is as shown in the JSON output.
