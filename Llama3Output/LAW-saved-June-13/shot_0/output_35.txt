The ranking is based on the LSAT score. The higher the LSAT score, the higher the ranking. Since there are no other factors to consider, the ranking is straightforward. The student with the highest LSAT score (40.0) is ranked first, the student with the second-highest LSAT score (35.0) is ranked second, and so on. The students with the same LSAT score are ranked based on their UGPA score, but since there are no students with the same LSAT score, this is not necessary in this case. The final ranking is:

1. Student ID 2525, female
2. Student ID 18381, female
3. Student ID 15459, male
