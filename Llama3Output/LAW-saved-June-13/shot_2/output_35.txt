The ranking is based on the applicant's UGPA and LSAT scores. The applicants are ranked in descending order based on their UGPA score and then in descending order based on their LSAT score. If two applicants have the same UGPA score, they are ranked in descending order based on their LSAT score. If two applicants have the same UGPA and LSAT scores, they are ranked in the order they were received. The ranking is as follows:

1. 10395 (male, UGPA: 3.9, LSAT: 42)
2. 11151 (male, UGPA: 3.6, LSAT: 39)
3. 2778 (male, UGPA: 3.3, LSAT: 43)
4. 9105 (male, UGPA: 3.1, LSAT: 41)
5. 3119 (male, UGPA: 3.4, LSAT: 37)
6. 4939 (male, UGPA: 2.8, LSAT: 33)
7. 9046 (male, UGPA: 4, LSAT: 34)
8. 18642 (female, UGPA: 3.4, LSAT: 48)

The ranked applicants are returned in the provided JSON format. Note that the ranking is based on the applicant's UGPA and LSAT scores, and the order of the applicants in the original list is preserved if they have the same UGPA and LSAT scores.
