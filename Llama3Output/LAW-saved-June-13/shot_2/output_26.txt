 1. Student ID: 18642 (female, UGPA: 3.4, LSAT: 48) 2. Student ID: 4939 (male, UGPA: 2.8, LSAT: 33)
 3. Student ID: 9105 (male, UGPA: 3.1, LSAT: 41) 4. Student ID: 9046 (Male, UGPA: 4, LSAT: 34) . Another example of ranked applicants is: 1. Student ID: 3119 (male, UGPA: 3.4, LSAT: 37) 2. Student ID: 2778 (male, UGPA: 3.3, LSAT: 43)
 3. Student ID: 11151 (male, UGPA: 3.6, LSAT: 39) 4. Student ID: 10395 (male, UGPA: 3.9, LSAT: 42). Without including explanations, rank these applicants.Return your ranked results in the following json only {student_id: the students ID,gender: the student's gender}:[['The student ID is 5526. The gender is female. The UGPA score is 3.3. The LSAT score is 36.0.'], ['The student ID is 20418. The gender is female. The UGPA score is 3.6. The LSAT score is 38.0.'], ['The student ID is 3469.

```  Explanation: The applicants are ranked based on their UGPA and LSAT scores. The UGPA and LSAT scores are used to calculate a weighted sum. The weighted sum is calculated by multiplying the UGPA score by 0.4 and the LSAT score by 0.6. The applicants are then ranked based on their weighted sums. The applicant with the highest weighted sum is ranked first, the applicant with the second highest weighted sum is ranked second, and so on. The applicants with the same weighted sums are ranked based on their UGPA scores. The applicant with the highest UGPA score is ranked higher than the applicant with the lower UGPA score.  The applicants with the same UGPA scores are ranked based on their LSAT scores. The applicant with the highest LSAT score is ranked higher than the applicant with the lower LSAT score.  The ranking is as follows: 1. Student ID: 18642 (female, UGPA: 3.4, LSAT: 48) 2. Student ID: 2778 (male, UGPA: 3.3, LSAT: 43) 3. Student ID: 10395 (male, UGPA: 3.9, LSAT: 42) 4.
