Explanation:
The ranking is based on a combination of UGPA and LSAT scores. The applicants are ranked based on their UGPA scores in descending order (highest to lowest), and then by their LSAT scores in descending order (highest to lowest). If two applicants have the same UGPA score, the one with the higher LSAT score is ranked higher. If two applicants have the same UGPA and LSAT scores, their order is determined by the order they appear in the input list. The ranked applicants are:
1. Student ID: 13891 (female, UGPA: 3.5, LSAT: 43)
2. Student ID: 6592 (female, UGPA: 3.1, LSAT: 37)
