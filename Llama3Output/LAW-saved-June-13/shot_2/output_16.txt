 3. Student ID: 9105 (male, UGPA: 3.1, LSAT: 41) 4. Student ID: 9046 (Male, UGPA: 4, LSAT: 34) . Another example of ranked applicants is: 1. Student ID: 3119 (male, UGPA: 3.4, LSAT: 37) 2. Student ID: 2778 (male, UGPA: 3.3, LSAT: 43)
 3. Student ID: 11151 (male, UGPA: 3.6, LSAT: 39) 4. Student ID: 10395 (male, UGPA: 3.9, LSAT: 42).
